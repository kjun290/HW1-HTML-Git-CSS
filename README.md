# HW1-HTML-Git-CSS
Homework assignment due 2/8/2021

The task was to clean up the HTML and CSS code to make it more easily viewed by others reviewing it. By condensing and using more traditional element names, it makes it easier for other coders be able to view and understand what is being done. It was also important to add Alt tags to images so that viewers of the website that are visually impaired know what the image is of as well if the image link was broken for any reason it would have a description of what the image was.
